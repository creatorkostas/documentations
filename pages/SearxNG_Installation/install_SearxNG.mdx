# Installing SearxNG

The installation for SearxNG is nothing more than clonning a repository
from the official [searxng-docker repository](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker) in github
and make some changes in 2 files.

First you go in the directory which you want to clone the repository and run this command to clone it, just as any repository.
```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker.git
```

Then you must make some changes in the settings and the .env file and you are ready to start using it!

### Let's start with the settings 

You must run this commnad inside the searxng-docker folder in the current directory
```bash copy
sed -i "s|ultrasecretkey|$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" searxng/settings.yml
```
This command will generate a random key and replace the "ultrasecretkey" with it in the settings.yml file in searxng folder

### Then it is the .env file

there you will find this 2 lines
```yml
# SEARXNG_HOSTNAME=<host>
# LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=<email>
```
The first one if you uncommend it you replace the "\<host\>" with a custom domain.
The second is to put your email in order to genarete a ssl certificate with Let's Encrypt.

You can leave it as it is and it will work just fine in localhost
