# Running SearxNG

To run SearxNG you just run this commnad in /path/to/repository/searxng-docker/
```bash copy
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
And you wait to pull the necessary conteiners and start it in the background

You can check that is up and running with
```bash copy
sudo docker ps
```
If you see 3 container redis,searxng,caddy the you can go yp [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080/) and start using it.

### Ther is not a searxng container!

If you are not seeing a searxng comntainer you can stop the containers with
```bash copy
sudo docker down
```

The start them without the option -d (in the forground)
```bash copy
sudo docker-compose up
```

If you see an error "cp: can't create '/etc/searxng/uwsgi.ini': Permission denied" you can fix it by giving write
permissions to the folder

```bash copy
chmod 764 ./searxng
```

or by
creating a new file in searxng folder with name "uwsgi.ini" and content
```ini copy
[uwsgi]
