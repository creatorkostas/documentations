# What is Docker?

Docker is a popular open-source platform used for containerization of applications. 
It allows developers to package applications and all their dependencies into a single container, 
which can then be deployed and run consistently across different environments, such as development, 
testing, and production.

### What is a container?

Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that provide a way to run 
applications in a predictable and reproducible way, regardless of the 
underlying infrastructure. Docker provides a standardized way to create, 
distribute, and run containers, making it easier to manage and scale applications.

### A little more about Docker.

Docker uses a client-server architecture, where the Docker client 
communicates with the Docker daemon, which manages containers and images. 
Docker images are templates for containers, which can be built, modified, and shared. 
Docker Hub is a central repository for storing and sharing Docker images.

Docker has become a popular tool for DevOps teams, as it simplifies the process of building, 
testing, and deploying applications. It can be used with a variety of programming languages 
and platforms, making it a versatile tool for developers.
