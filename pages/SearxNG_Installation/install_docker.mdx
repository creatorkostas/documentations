# Docker installation

```bash copy
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

docker.io is the docker engine and docker-compose is a package that allow you to
deploy one or more containers with a single command from docker-compose.yml file.

### Package not found!

This commands is for ubuntu for more distributions you can see the [official site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

If you get an error that one or both packages not found then you have to put the docker repository
into the available repositories

Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
```bash copy
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
  ca-certificates \
  curl \
  gnupg
```

Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
```bash copy
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

Use the following command to set up the repository:
```bash copy
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Then you can install the packages normaly through the package manager
```bash copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```
