# What is SearxNG?

SearxNG is a free and open-source metasearch engine software that allows users to search for 
information on the internet while preserving their privacy. It is a fork of the original 
Searx metasearch engine, and it was created to address some of the limitations of the 
original software and to add new features.

SearxNG is designed to be privacy-focused and does not track users' search queries or store 
any personal information. It also allows users to choose which search engines to use for their 
queries, and it can combine the results from multiple search engines to provide more 
comprehensive and diverse search results.

One of the key features of SearxNG is its ability to be self-hosted, which means that users can 
install and run the software on their own servers, giving them full control over their search 
data and privacy. Additionally, SearxNG supports multiple languages and can be customized to suit 
the specific needs of individual users or organizations.

Overall, SearxNG is a powerful and flexible search engine that prioritizes user privacy and customization.
